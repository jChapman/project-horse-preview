The cost to upgrade your shop decreases by 1\n      each round.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      Outside of the game, where can I see all the Gods and Spells?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      You can’t yet, but it’s coming soon to the website!\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Will you continue to balance the game?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">YES!</div>\n    <h2>General</h2>\n    <div class=\"question\">What’s with the letters next to the heroes?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      The letters represent the hero’s rank such that (S>A>B>C>D), where S is\n      the strongest and D is the weakest. This is determined by things such as\n      melee/range, stat gain, base stats, and attack range.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      Is an S tier hero always better than lower tier heroes?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      No! You wouldn’t want Primal Beast (S tier) being your spellcaster, but\n      maybe Tinker or Zeus (D tier) instead.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">How do I get more heroes?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Every player will get a new hero body at rounds 1, 3, 6, 9, 12. These are\n      guaranteed to be a certain rank: D at 1, C at 3, B at 6, A at 9, and S at\n      12. When selecting a body, you can click ALT to compare stats with all 3\n      bodies at once.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">What does rerolling my hero body do?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Rerolling your hero body costs 2 gold and gives you a choice of 3 random\n      heroes to replace it with. You will always be offered one strength, one\n      agility, and one intelligence hero. They can be from any tier, meaning you\n      can even get an S tier body early in the game.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Rerolling your hero is important, but should be secondary to managing your\n      spells. When rerolling your hero, they will retain their equipped spells\n      at no cost. If you do not select a hero, you will be given a random one of\n      the 3 choices. If the preparation phase ends while rerolling a hero, it\n      will give you a random choice. Be careful not to reroll your hero when the\n      fighting phase is merely a second away.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Does it matter where I place my heroes?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      A good placement is important for success. You don’t want your backline to\n      be vulnerable, nor do you want your frontliners to be ignored. It’s also\n      important to consider AOE abilities that your opponent might have.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">What does the spell deck do?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      The spell deck shows you what spells may show up in the shop. Every player\n      selects spells from this same pool, and the number on the top right corner\n      of each spell tells you how many “copies” of the spell remain in the pool.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      A spell with more copies left will naturally be more frequently offered in\n      the shop, so you can use this to know which spells you can try to get to\n      Gaben. When a player is eliminated, all of their spells are returned to\n      the pool.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Does my God influence how I should play?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Yes, but not completely. You should be aware of your God ability and what\n      benefits it offers to you. Utilize this to your advantage, but don’t\n      narrow your choices too much.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Who worked on this game?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Here’s a list of\n      <a href=\"https://abilityarena.com/credits\" target=\"_blank\">Our Team</a>\n    </div>\n    <h2>Mechanics</h2>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      How can I tell what spells you changed from regular Dota?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Some spells have been slightly changed to be more balanced in our mode. If\n      you’ve picked one of these spells, you will notice a “Difference to Dota”\n      text at the bottom of the tooltip, which explains any changes we made from\n      the base game. This text may also contain AI rules for specific spells\n      (ie: Empower & Life Break)\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Can I move spells between heroes?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Yes, you can move spells to other heroes at the cost of 1 gold. Bench\n      spells can move to a hero without any cost, but moving a spell from a hero\n      to the bench costs 1 gold.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Why do my heroes switch targets?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Heroes will attack the closest enemy, so if enemy heroes move around then\n      your units may switch targets. Some spells have unique AI which doesn’t\n      follow this rule. Heroes will not attack summons.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Is there any way to know my next opponent?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      No. The only information you have regarding this is that you won’t face\n      the same opponent twice in a row until there aren’t enough players to\n      choose from. The game generally tries to select a variety of opponents.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Why is my opponent glowing white?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      You are playing their ghost. This occurs when there are an odd number of\n      players. You can never be matched up against a player that has already\n      lost. A ghost enemy will deal damage to you, but you will not deal damage\n      to the original player if you win.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      My God involves getting more Spell points, what does that mean?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Spell points are simply the amount of duplicate spells you have in total.\n      Depending on the God you are playing, spell points can be very important.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      How do spell charges work with bodies (ie Finger or Culling Blade stacks)\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      All charges are tied to the ability itself. If you move the ability to a\n      different hero, all of those charges will transfer over as well.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Can a hero equip multiple ultimate abilities?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      No. Each hero is only allowed one ultimate ability. Only the Donkey\n      Aghanim God has an ability which circumvents this.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Why does Impetus not proc Essence Flux</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Because that is how it is coded in regular Dota (Arcane Orb is a specific\n      exception in the base game)\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">How is round damage determined?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Round number + number of remaining heroes * shop level\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Are there hotkeys in the game (ie: Re-rolling)?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">Yes, if you hold ALT, it will show them all.</div>\n    <h2>Monetization</h2>\n    <div class=\"question\">How do I unlock more Gods?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Everyone has the same starter Gods. Aghanim God can be unlocked by\n      completing the 7-day newcomer quest. Shopkeeper and Tinker can be\n      purchased with coins.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      There is also a God tied to the Battle Pass every season, which you can\n      unlock for free if you get to level 40. The rest of the Gods will drop\n      from God chests.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Purchasing a PLUS subscription will also give you 2 Gods that will rotate\n      each month. The PLUS Gods can drop from chests as well.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">What will seasons look like going forward?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Seasons will typically be a month long. With each season the following\n      will be added:\n      <ul>\n        <li>New spells rotating in and out</li>\n        <li>\n          2 new Gods (1 tied to the Battle Pass and the other droppable from God\n          Chests)\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          New rotation for PLUS Gods (which will include the previous month’s\n          Battle Pass God)\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          A brand new Battle Pass themed around one of the new Gods. The Battle\n          Pass will always include Finishers, Arenas, and Avatars based on the\n          themed God.\n        </li>\n        <li>Leaderboard rank reset</li>\n        <li>New cosmetics to drop from chests</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      Will my subscription to PLUS be auto-renewed every month?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">No</div>\n    <div class=\"question\">I have a promo code, where can I enter it?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      In-game you need to click the store icon at the top left, and then the\n      promo code button at the bottom left of the window\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      Will my regular Dota cosmetics be shown in this game?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">Yup!</div>\n    <div class=\"question\">Does my Terrain influence how I should play?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Terrains and many other things (avatar accessories, hats, etc.) are purely\n      cosmetic and don’t influence gameplay at all.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">How do I redeem my consumables?</div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Open the Armory tab either in-game or on this site. The Armory contains\n      all your consumables and cosmetics.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"question\">\n      Will I get anything for being a high rank at the end of the season?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"answer\">\n      Yes, you will get exclusive cosmetics for this.
